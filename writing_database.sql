Anything includes rescuing the kidnapped de&rsquo;Liraan prince for the reward money to finance the rebels, who are low on funds. Royce succeeds in rescuing Prince Derick, dragging him, along with his sister Rory and the two passengers on their ship, Kaiya and the talentless bard Nicholas, into a dangerous adventure. The five of them find themselves on the run, doggedly pursued by the kidnappers, who are determined to get back the prince by any means necessary. What Royce does not know is that Derick cannot simply return home because his own brother Prince Cael is the one out to kill him. Tension rises on the ship as Royce and Derick clash more and more, especially as Royce notices his sister getting too friendly with the prince, and they begin to suspect that someone onboard is out to get them. All in all, Royce is realizing there would have been easier ways to fund the rebels.</span></p>','ADVE',4,4),(4,'The Victor','<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Derick has not felt truly safe since his brother Cael attempted to take the throne, killing their father and attempting to kill Derick, before being defeated and escaping. Now Cael has returned with the support of some of the nobility, determined to take the throne once and for all. Launching a surprise attack with the aid of his nobles, he takes the capital and quickly proceeds to take over much of the rest of the country before Derick can regroup. As civil war begins between the brothers, the rebels, led by Royce, see their opportunity, taking over land in the north. Finding himself at war with both his brother and the rebels, Derick is mostly powerless to do anything to help his country. Meanwhile, Royce is preparing, hoping that, after Derick&rsquo;s inevitable defeat, the rebels will be strong enough to withstand the full force of Cael&rsquo;s fury and defeat him. Three men--Derick de&rsquo;Liraan, Royce de&rsquo;Blanc, and Cael de&rsquo;Liraan--are fighting for control of Mercagea. Who will win and become the victor?</span></p>','ADVE',4,4),(5,'The King','<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">It has been a year since Derick\'s brother Cael attempted to kill him and Derick became king. While Derick is certain his brother is merely biding his time, nothing has been seen of Cael since and a tense peace reigns over the Kingdom of Mercagea. When Royce, who had supposedly quit smuggling and cut ties with the rebels, is nearly murdered, Derick and Rory discover he is secretly back to his old ways, prompting Royce to run away and return to the rebels. Derick finds himself with enemies on both sides as the rebels grow and Cael returns, clearly determined to take the throne, even at the cost of war. The situation further deteriorates as the rebels fight amongst themselves and Royce makes it clear that he will not accept a truce with Derick, even to stop Cael. With the country on the brink of a three way civil war, Derick struggles to attempt to be the kind of king who can lead his country to victory.</span></p>','ADVE',4,4),(6,'Checkmate','<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">What would you do if you found out you were destined to save another world?</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">That is exactly the question high school senior Devon has to deal with when he learns that he is really from a fantasy world named Agren and is prophesied to save it. Devon&rsquo;s world is turned upside down as he attempts to learn to be a hero, including a hands on lesson on saving a maiden from a dragon, which does not exactly go as planned. Things are finally starting to settle down--at least as much as they can when you&rsquo;re prophesied to save a fantasy world--when Devon learns that Agren is in danger. A man named the Chess King is attempting to take over the country, and, to make matters worse, he knows about Devon and the prophesy.</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">When the Chess King kidnaps Devon, Devon realizes it is time to act and become a hero. He escapes and sets off to save the country, along with his goofy best friend Trevor; twins Hunter and Arianna, who are definitely up to something; and Katia, a girl who is supposedly from Agren and is a constant, but terrible, liar. Even with Devon prophesied to save Agren, can these five mismatched characters possible save anything, let alone an entire country?</span></p>','FANT',4,0),(7,'The Spy Game','<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While most people would never consider moving to an enemy country, Alek has been quite happy in Alyion for the last two years. After all, he never cared much about the tense political relations between his native country of Caladara and its hostile neighbor. However, when the semi-retired safe cracker is framed for a high profile, government robbery, he has little choice but to accept a job from Alyion&rsquo;s top spymaster Quinten Reed.</span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">During his training, Alek meets Sophia, a girl with strange associates and an even stranger ability to always seem to know when he is in danger. Soon, he is deployed to Caladara, where he finds his past uncomfortably close with his former gang and driven police detective Carl Ellery both hot on his trail. In desperation, he turns himself in and agrees to work as a double agent against his Alyionian spymasters. Sent back to Alyion, he struggles to stay one step ahead of Quinten Reed and his associates. As everything collapses around Alek, Sophia lets him in on a secret and pulls him even deeper into a clandestine world of international intrigue, corrupt spymasters, and unethical experiments.</span></p>','SFIC',18,0),(8,'Super Spies','<p></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Everything is going well for the superheroes of Shadow Rock City until Ellie gets a phone call from Tyler, saying Olivia, Zach, and Andi have run into trouble on a spy mission and been captured. Aidan, Rochelle, Ellie, and Tyler go to rescue them, but the captors are clearly prepared for people with their powers. When Zach&rsquo;s evil twin Ezekiel mysteriously vanishes from prison and a huge heist that should be impossible goes off without a hitch, the teens know Ezekiel has big plans. But how is he doing all this and how will they be able to catch him now that he appears to be able to vanish into thin air?</span></p>','SFIC',18,6),(9,'The (Not So) Easy Life of a Superhero','<p></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">David Jackson loves all things superhero. He collects the comics, has all the action figures, daydreams about saving the world, follows every plot line and hero, and happens to have the ability to control the wind. So when his big sister Danica gives him the opportunity to join her newly formed superhero team, he jumps at the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Being a superhero starts out as great as David had always imagined it. The team has a bit of a rough start, thanks to a leadership dispute between Danica and Jeffrey Anderson, but soon they are using their powers to help the citizens of Shadow Rock City and their work and popularity grows when the son of Shadow Rock City&rsquo;s old nemesis shows up.<br /> <br /> The new villain, Invincible II, gives the superhero team a run for their money, but David is confident they can defeat him. After all, it&rsquo;s seven against one and everyone knows the heroes always win. At least he is confident before the superheroes start getting killed. The superhero team begins unravelling, and what David believed was impossible is happening: the superheroes are losing.</span></p>','SFIC',18,6),(10,'Super Summer','<p></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Everything was going well for Aidan and his friends. They saved Shadow Rock City the fall before and now have hung up their capes and are taking a well deserved break, hoping that they are done with supervillains. However, that peace ends when Aidan&rsquo;s aunt Elizabeth is kidnapped by an unknown supervillain. Aidan&rsquo;s father Jeremy and Elizabeth&rsquo;s husband David immediately go to find and rescue her, telling the four teens--Aidan, Elizabeth&rsquo;s kids Ellie and Tony, and David&rsquo;s niece Rochelle--to stay safe at home. Tony has no intention of following his stepfather&rsquo;s orders, but the other three plan on it--a plan that quickly fails when a new villain comes to Shadow Rock City. The four teens, with the long distance help of Aidan&rsquo;s cousin Andi Anderson, who&rsquo;s away at S.P.Y. (Spy Preparation Year) to begin to learn to be a spy, and Aidan&rsquo;s best friend Cody Parker, who&rsquo;s inconveniently on a long vacation right when they need him, try to defeat the new villains. It seems easy at first, until strange things start happening--a dead villain returns; they lose contact with Jeremy and David right when they realize that the two men are walking right into a trap; and, worst of all, their own powers begin working against them.</span></p>','SFIC',18,6),(11,'Sure, You Can Save the World','<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Being in middle school is hard enough. It is extra hard when you are really a superhero.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That is what Aidan Anderson, the alter ego of the Torpedo, faces, as he tries to navigate middle school; save his city; keep his identity a secret; and, as his mom is <em>always</em> reminding him, not forget to do his homework. Aidan&rsquo;s sidekicks are his talking dog Dixie, aka the Jackal, and his best friend Cody. Together, the three of them battle evil in Shadow Rock City.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When a new villain, Obsidian, comes to town, Aidan, Dixie, and Cody have their work cut out for them.

Raimund Dellmoor, who prefers his associates to call him M in private, is up to something nefarious at the court of the neighboring Kingdom of Ristaera, but Cal really could not care less as to what as long as she can find a way to stay one step ahead of him and betray him before he has a chance to do it to her, as rats inevitably do.</span></p>','ADVE',28,0),(16,'Facade','<p><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the near future-a virtual reality machine known as H-21 is being prepared to destroy the nations of the world, to create a new government and turn aside the old ways of the past.&nbsp;</span><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\" /><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Easy access--one insert placed on the neck to the brain cell places the wearer in any place if they have the suitable zone-card.
